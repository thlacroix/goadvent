My solutions to the Advent of Code challenge, starting with 2018:
https://adventofcode.com/2018

I'm usually solving the problems in the morning they come out, and pushing them
when I have time to do some cleaning (mostly adding basic comments and removing
debugging code).

The solutions are not always the best ones, but I'm trying to have a good
asymptotic time complexity. When the impact is not too big, I allow myself to
use suboptimal operations for code simplicity, but try to say so in the comments.
